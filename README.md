# Udacity MyReads Project

Browse restaurants, or filter them by neighborhood and/or type of cuisine.


## Getting started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project running on your local machine


### Installing

You will need a Windows, Mac, or Linux based operating system and access to the internet in order to run this project.
Either clone or download and unzip the files to your local directory. Your installation should include the following files:

* `/css/styles.css`
* `/data/restaurants.json`
* `/js/dbhelper.js`
* `/js/main.js`
* `/js/restaurant_info.js`
* `/sw.js`
* `/index.html ``
* `/restaurant.html`
* and an `img` folder with ten jpg's


###  Dependencies

Python is recommended to run an http server. In your terminal, or git bash, run `python -V` to verify which version of Python you have (if any). If you have Python 2, use command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. For Python 3, use command `python3 -m http.server 8000`. [Visit their website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software, if you don't have either version on your system. Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.


## Using Restaurant Reviews

Clicking on a restaurant's map marker, or "View More" button, will direct you to a new page with more detailed information about that restaurant, including operating hours and reviews.
